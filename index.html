    <h4 class="smalltitle"><strong>Galanthus: A Pluto Story</strong></h4> 
        <p>A Space Opera taking place in an alternate version of our very own solar system named the Milky Way Sector. A place where Venus is a beautiful desert planet and Saturn is a lavish cloud planet filled with luxurious cities. A place where the planets are ruled by an egotistical conquering alien race known as the planeterians, due to their planet-like strength and abilities.</p>
        <p>The Milky Way Alliance, which encompassed the strongest planeterian monarchs in the Milky Way Sector, they ruled over the Milky Way Sector and were its planeterian representatives. Pluto, the weakest member kicked out one day by his stoic manager Jupiter, when he realized Pluto had been misclassified and actually belonged at the very bottom of the Planeterian Hierarchy as a Dwarf Grade Planeterian. Members of the race that are at the bottom are seen as inferior and weak and are shunned into isolation. Power is very important to the planeterians as they conquer solar systems casually and make planets into their personal homes and kingdoms.</p>
        <p>Due to the strict planeterian rules about the interacting with the lowest grade, Pluto and his planet Pluton were excommunicated from the Milky Sector. Pluto lived alone for years only with his best friend, Charon, on a once attraction filled winter wonderland now turn barren snow planet riddled with ghost towns. Finally after deciding enough is enough and he wants to prove that despite his low class he can accomplish anything a higher ranking Planeterian can through hard work. Whilst Eris, another dwarf grade planeterian wants to do away with the whole power based Planeterian Hierarchy by causing chaos amongst them and exposing their cruel way in an attempt to gain more followers</p>
        <p>The adventures of a timid duo, chivalrous alien named Pluto and his partner in crime Charon, to regain their spot in the Milky Way Alliance and dispel the notion that the lowest tier of their race's hierarchy system can't amount to nothing.</p>
