    <p class="arcs"><strong>The Ouranos Arc</strong></p>
    <p class="one">The first story arc of Galanthus. We are introduced to our main characters and the main antagonist(s). Pluto, fed up with moping around, is finally motivated to get his positions back through sheer determination and the help from his partner in crime Charon. The duo planned on traveling to Saturn to learn more about their culture and use it against the same culture that kicked them out.</p>
    <p class="one">
    Luck goes their way once a cargo pod crash lands on their planet, they help the pilot and hide on his ship. When he wakes up from his rest he goes to thank the two, and can't seem to find them so he leaves a note a gets back on his travel course. Their plan goes awry when they land on Ouranos instead of Saturn, turns out the cargo pod they hide on wasn't going to Saturn, it had just came from Saturn.</p>
    <p class="one">
    Whilst on Ouranos they run into the children of Uranus, Pluto's former co-worker. Uranus' children are super loyal to the Planeterian Hierarchy, and after realizing Pluto and Charon and outlaws after stepping on a Celestial Grade Planeterian's Planet without permission, they proceed to capture him. And as their punishment they planned to give Pluto and Charon to Uranus to become a member of her Harem.</p>
