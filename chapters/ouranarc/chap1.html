        <p style="text-indent: 0px; "><strong>Chapter One: Strife </strong></p>
        <p>We open our story with a blue streak, a small spherical pod, soaring through the vast dark ocean that is outer-space. Thousands of bright flashing orbs light up the dark abyss, guiding our lone blue streak towards its new home. It least she hopes.</p>
        <p class="text-center" style="text-indent: 0px; ">***</p>
        <p>Eris, a scrawny, raggedy blue hair juvenile, sits balled up in the pilot seat. Her torn gray hoodie is soaked in tears. She’s fed up with her life, she’s fed up with her home. The Milky Way Sector is a rather large plain filled with numerous planets and celestial objects. Eris is from the outskirts. Born on a random nameless snowy tundra planet, who’s kind is far too common in the outskirts of the Milky Way. The days are long, dark, and quite mundane. The only exciting thing that ever goes on there are the space debris and meteors crashing down.<em> It’s so annoying! They always kick in at the wrong time and they take forever to leave.</em> She grew up in constant fear of the loud planet shaking collisions. And the worse thing is Eris had no one to share the pain with.</p>
        <p>She was fed up. Her paper pale face was burning red with anger and cooled off by a stream of tears out pouring from her eyes. Her igloo, her home, the only place she felt safe had finally fallen victim to this savage planet. Eris’ heart felt as if it were burning too as she look at her burning home. A meteor must’ve done this, she thought as she clenched her fists and sobbed. </p>
        <p> “WHY! W-why me?” wept Eris has she fell to her knees. “I don’t understand it, why was I born in this situation. Why am I all alone? Why is there no one else her?” The same thoughts she wakes up to each day were finally leaving her mouth. Bzzzt! Eris stops her sobbing immediately. Bzzzt! </p>
        <p> “Huh? What was that?” Eris franticly shakes her head both ways trying to locate that strangle sound, “Mhm, it’s prolly rumble falling in my broken home” she says as she looks down in disappointment. VROOSH! </p>
        <p>The flames engulf the melting igloo like a hunger beast and spits out a spherical space craft. “Wait?! A delivery pod?! What’s one of those doing round here?!” Eris bolts to the spacecrafts at its current resting place in a mound of snow. It was a rather small delivery pod but still several sizes bigger than her. It was shaped like a metallic orb with one large cylindrical thruster in the back, and three circular windows. The largest window was in on the front center, and the other two where one the sides. </p>
        <p>“Hmm, the pilot must have ejected long before this crashed” Eris mumbles to herself as she peaked through the side view window. “He’s probably worried sick that he’ll get fired for leaving he work pod behind,” Eris says to herself as a mischievous smirk begins to show itself. “I should be a good person and get this too him, it’s not even damaged after all, just a few scratches.” <em>Finally, she thought to herself, a way off this forsaken planet.</em> She had never felt so much relief in her life. Eris began frantically looking for the pod’s more door. </p>
        <p>“Found it!” Eris yells for the top of the pod. She spits on her palms and rubs them together with confidence. “RRRRG!” <em>That hatchet was closed a lot more tightly than I thought,</em> she thinks to herself as she puffs heavily trying to catch her breath. She felt along the perimeter of the hatchet to see if she could get a better grip. “Huh, what’s this, a dent?!” Another menacing smile reared its ugly butt on Eris’ face. She began chuckling like a devious creature. “Hehehe.” She hops off the pod and lands gently on the ground using her special talent of levitation. She dashes towards the ruble whilst dusting of the snow on her knees. She rummages through the debris and find a piece of her broken wooden door. Her grin runs circles around her petit face as she hugs her broken door. “Sorry I’m living you behind, it’s for the best” she says the pile of ashes that is now her home. She runs eagerly towards the pod. </p>
        <p>Eris reaches the base of the pod and with her door in hand begins squatting and stretching. “Here we go again”. Zoopt! Her hops right over the pod and lands gently on its roof. “Finally,” Eris says to herself with satisfaction, “This talent of mine is finally coming to good use”. She sticks one end of the door into the gap between the pod’s dent and hatchet, and with a lot of elbow grease she manages to pry the pod’s hatchet open. She hops in a closes the hatchet behind her. The inside was gloomy and filled with broken glass from the ceiling lights. She makes her way the pilots seat and inspects the control panel. </p>
        <p>“Okay, one of these buttons gets me the heck outta here, hmm, might be this one.” Eris pushes a small red button located right of a joystick. VRRWOOOSH! Eris flies all the way to the back of the pod and hits her back with her huge thump! The view of her home from the main window begins to get wider and wider has if she’s zooming out of it. In the blink of an eye all she sees is the twinkling stars of the night sky. </p>
        <p>Eris dashes the side view windows. “OH MY GOSH! THIS IS CRAZY!” Eris falls down to her knees and cries, “I can believe I’m finally off that frozen potato.” Eris comes to her senses and stops crying. Her emotions fly out the window and leave her an empty husk. She blankly stares at the main window. “I don’t know my way around here” she says as drop of water begins to crawl its way out of her eye, “I don’t know how to pilot, oh my gosh oh my gosh, I didn’t think this through!” Eris sits down in the pilot seat and rolls up into a ball. She has no more tears to cry. Full of sadness and regret she goes to sleep. </p>
        <p class="text-center" style="text-indent: 0px; ">***</p>
        <p>She’s been traveling for who knows how long now in this dark abyss. She’s tired, she’s hungry, bored at looking at the same stars and at the same pitch-black sky. “I’m surprised I’ve made it this far,” she say to herself, “Maybe there’s still hope for me.” Eris stretches and yawns and goes back to looking out the windows. “Huh, do my eyes deceive me, is that a tan star? Wait a second, stars don’t come in tan, that must mean…” Eris begins to connect the dots. “FINALLY! A PLANET!” Explodes Eris with excitement. A gentle smile lifts her gloomy mood. </p>
        <p>The planet starts increasing in size at an unbelievable rated. “Hmm, after looking at the same scenery for so long I forgot how fast this thing was actually going.” </p>
        <p>Has the ship gets closer the mysterious tan planet Eris leans in closer and closer to the window. The planet is of the cloud variety. Ploop! The delivery pod flies through the atmosphere of the planet and becomes engulfed with flames. In the blink of an eye the pod takes of the coat of flames like a jacket on a summer’s day. "Ooh!" Eris says, "This thing is fire proof, that's way it didn't get destroyed in my house fire." Eris stops mid thought as she becomes mesmerized by the view of the planets interiors. Dozens of levitating sky cities populate the skyline. </p>
        <p>She's so relived to finally be on a planet, and she is ecstatic that this one is booming life. All around her are illuminating cloud cities, connected to one another. She hears sounds of laugher and sees flashing lights, welcoming her to this new world. She feels at peace. Eris loses touch with reality; she's never felt this way before. VRWOOOOSH! CRSHHH! Eris slams into the large spherical main window and is finally connected back with reality. It finally occurs to her that SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO FLY THIS THING! </p>
        <p>She crashes in a strange location. Luckily for her it was a nice open space, all the nearest buildings were away from her. "Ouch!" She says to herself and she tries to lift the ruble of herself. Yellow liquid ozzes out her her legs, arms, and forehead. "<em>Ow Ow Ow,</em> it stings, I luckily to have survived that. The pain could be worse." She doesn't let the fact that she bleeding stops her from exploring her surroundings. She takes of her torn hoodie and wipes the blood onto it. She then wraps the hoodie around her waist. </p>
        <p>She notices a mansion nearby. What she doesn't is that nearby mansion she's looking at actually belongs to Jupiter, one of the strongest planeterians in the Milky Way Galaxy. Jupiter’s kids Calisto, Ganymede rush out to see her. Eris is frozen with shock. "T-they look j-just like me." </p>
        <p>They have menacing expressing written all over their faces. "Oo, well lookie what we have here an intruder" says Calisto. </p>
        <p>"Why don't we teach her what we do to intruders" says Ganymede. </p>
        <p>"That won't be necessary. Calisto, Ganymede, get your butts back inside" says a thick boned, well dressed, bald man with a handle bar moustache. "Who are you and what are you doing here? Make it quick because I am currently dealing with important issues." </p>
        <p>"I’m Eris. I-I’m from the outskirts. It’s lonely there, it’s lonely, it’s scary, I don’t wanna be there anymore more. Please let me stay here. I don’t even where I am. I just know I don’t want to be there anymore." </p>
        <p>"Where exactly are you from?" says Jupiter. </p>
        <p>"I don’t k-know exactly. There." She says as she points towards a distant white planet. It’s barely visible in the cloudy sky. But due to her home world being made of mostly snow and ice, a lot of the sunlight gets reflected. Jupiter takes another brief glance at her. </p>
        <p>"You look different, but I suppose you look somewhat like me. Our complexion is similar. Our hair texture is similar. Tell me child, do you know anything about geo-forces?" </p>
        <p>Eris confused and bewildered replies, "No I don’t. What is that?" </p>
        <p>"It’s a force that only my race is capable of manipulating. It is a, what do you call it. A umm, a special talent." </p>
        <p>"I don’t know what you are talking about, but I do have a special talent!" Eris squads down and leaps into the air, she levitates briefing before gently falling back down to the ground. </p>
        <p>Jupiter's eyes widen. This is a planeterian, he thinks to himself. A super advanced and developed race capable of manipulating gravitational forces. An egotistically and prideful race consumed by power and greed. They conquer planets for a living and rule them and their galaxies in the form of sectors. But they are not all built equally. Jupiter is the best of the best, despite his chubby appearance, he is a celestial planeterian capable of doing extraordinary feats. But this Eris girl, she is different. She is short and scrawny. Something of about her, he knows it. </p>
        <p>"Hmm, you remind me of a friend of mine. I always knew he was different. It appears the two of you have more in common than I do with him. Tell me, have you had of a dwarf?" The gears in Jupiter’s head begin turning. </p>
        <p>"No? What is that?" say a curious Eris. </p>
        <p>"Look around child. You are currently in the Milky Way Sector. This is one of the many planeterian ruled galaxies in the universe. Members of our race like me add on our race's glorious name, but you. Whilst members like you take away from it. Dwarf grade planterians. Small and weak, undercooked and fragile. The fact that such a puny impact caused that much damage to you is evidence enough. I feel bad for you and you all you have been through, I truly do. But the reputation of my people matter more to me. Thank you, you have made me realize something I should've done a long time ago." </p>
        <p>"Wait! Wait! What is a dwarf, what are you going on about?! Can you please help me?! Eris begins crying. </p>
        <p>Jupiter turns his back and leaves, he gestures to his kids. "Get her out of here, she's dwarf grade, she doesn't belong here. They know they don’t belong here. I don’t know where these defects keep coming from, but they are making us look bad." <em>This explains so much, Jupiter thinks to himself, why he is always underachieving, why he's always falling behind. I can't believe it’s fallen below my radar for so long. Have the others known, I can’t be the only one that has been oblivious to this injustice. </em></p>
        <p>Jupiter truly values his reputation. He is stoic and cold. He is as egoistically has they come, he is never wrong. </p>
        <p>"Please Mr. can you please help?!" cries Eris. But Jupiter is not listening. </p>
        <p>"You said you from there right?" asks Calisto smugly. </p>
        <p>"Y-yeah why" she replies. </p>
        <p>Calisto and Ganymede smirk at each other. The two grab Eris by the arms and begin the spin her around, getting faster and faster with each rotation. </p>
        <p>"AND THERE SHE GOES!" the duo call out as they chuck her off into space with a mighty throw. </p>
        <p>"I think we were off" says Ganymede. </p>
        <p>"Ehh, what does it matter?" replies Calisto. </p>
        <p>Eris lands on a distant planet. Severely bruised. She doesn’t get it. Does people were just like her. Why didn’t they take her in? Because she was a 'dwarf'? She was too weak too fragile? he was mad and frustrated. She hated this hierarchy she never even knew existed. "Why me" she cried, "What did I do to deserve this? If they felt my pain they would never do this again!" said Eris. Her blood began to boil with rage. "I don’t care, they said they're more people like me huh. I’m gonna find them and form a group of us. We might be 'weak' but if there are many of us we will be able to overpower them and teach them a lesson of what pain isolation feel like. I’m gonna change this stupid system." </p>
        <p class="text-center" style="text-indent: 0px; ">***</p>
        <p>We zoom out from Eris and the mysterious cold barren planet in the outskirts of the Milky Way Sector. The stars begin to shift as we rotate and focus on a different planet. A creamy tundra planet not too far from where we once were. Pluton once home to the great monarch Pluto and his advisor Charon. Five month months later, it is the home to the now evicted and reclassified dwarf Pluto and Charon. </p>
