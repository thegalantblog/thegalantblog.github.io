    <div class="container pads butter">
        <p style="text-indent: 0px; "><strong>Chapter Two: Mundane Day</strong></p>
        <p>A petit pale shaggy brown haired juvenile hops out of bed, with disappointment written all over his face. He is wearing light blue pajamas and white tube socks, the brightest things in his dark and gloomy room. He slugs towards his small bedroom’s bathroom, dragging his arms on the ground on his way. Grabs is blue tooth and passionlessly brushes his teeth. After is finishes and spits, rinses, the slugs straight down stairs to go get something to eat to keep him going. As he makes his way down the steps he miscalculates and trips on a step causing him to fly to the bottom. He crashes onto his hallway fall. Not evening paying attention to the massive dents and crackles he gets back up. </p>
        <p>“I should really repair that spot,” he croaks, “Eh, what does it matter, it’s not like I get visitors often.” He slumps off into his barren kitchen; brushing of any physical pain is just experienced. He frown was his anesthetic. His kitchen had one plain white round table made of not fine wood but cheaply assembled frozen ice. He heads to his counter to grab his single coffee mug. It had a picture of familiar faces wrapping around it. A tear began to tip toe down his cheek. </p>
        <p>He made his one to his sink and pour steaming hot water into his cup. He then proceeded to go into his cupboard and grab a tea bag. He rips the container open and brings to dip the tea bag into the boiling water. He once would be mesmerized by the color change followed by the sudden appearance of a light film encompassing the tea. Now the experience is void of excitement. It’s so mundane. </p>
        <p>He sips his tea and slumps to his front yard. He sits on his porch and looks at the frozen barren tundra. Creamy brown snow blankets the land around him. There were some dull round mountains that border his house to the south. Behind those mountains on the other side was once the home to a great tourism site and small city. Now it’s a ghost town. </p>
        <p>He sighs to himself. “Things used to be so good, what happened?” He moans has he looks to the sky. Even though it was day time he could still see the bright stars swimming in the sky above him. The only thing separating him and space was a light blue tint. A fragile atmosphere. </p>
        <p>“Pluto! Pluto!” calls out an eager young girl with a short bob cut and brown hair that brightens the area around her. Pluto frown flips into a large welcoming grin, and his heart begins to thaw out.
        <p>“Charon! I haven’t seen you I weeks!” he says eagerly.</p>
        <p>“Oh you know, nothing, the usually” she replies. </p>
        <p>“You can say that again. Things have been rather dry ever since Jupiter kicked us out.” Pluto moans. The sadness is beginning to creep its ugly head back. </p>
        <p class="text-center" style="text-indent: 0px; ">***</p>
        <p>“Pluto,” says Jupiter, “After a recent encounter with someone I’ve finally pieced together why you keep letting me down. The reason why you’re so behind the others, it’s because you’re a dwarf.” </p>
        <p>“Huh, what are you talking about? What do you mean? A dwarf, what is that? Is it because I’m small?” </p>
        <p class="text-center" style="text-indent: 0px; ">***</p>
        <p>“Aww, cheer up bud. I know it feels bad having you long time friend kick you out of your job over something dumb. I know it sucks that we’re pretty much seen has trash by our whole race, and no one what’s to be associated with us, but screw them. It doesn’t matter. You’ll always have me” says Charon as she bear hugs Pluto. </p>
        <p>“You’re not really helping Char, you’re just reminding me of all the things causing my depression,” say Pluto bitterly, “There goes trying to forget it.” </p>
        <p>“Ssshh” says Charon with a devious smile covers Pluto mouth before it can darken the mood anymore, “I have a surprise for you! You won’t believe what I saw!” </p>
        <p>“Hmm, what Charon?” muffles Pluto from Charon’s suffocating hug. </p>
        <p>“We have a visitor!” sings Charon. </p>
        <p>“A-a visitor, b-but I thought we were excommunicated from the Milk Way Sector. Pluton is just another floating ball of ice and rock. We don’t even appear on the maps now!” says Pluto frantically trying to rationalize the news he’s hearing. </p>
        <p>“Weeell, someone must’ve gotten lost” says Charon. Her Grin widens and she throws her hands behind her back. </p>
        <p>“Charon, did you do something…” pauses a skeptical Pluto, “Did you sabotage someone’s ship?!” </p>
        <p>“Nooo” says Charon looking away guiltily. Pluto without hesitating hugs Charon. </p>
        <p>“Oh well, if you don’t know then it must have be fate.” Pluto winks and Charon and goes in again for a second hug. “You know we should start preparing for them, they are gonna be lost once they arrive. So when do you think they’re gonna arrive?” </p>
        <p>“Ooh, I don’t know.” Charon draws out her words whilst looking to the sky for a malfunctioning ship, “I’d say about…” BREWOOSH! “NOW!” </p>
        <p>“Aah, Charon, what did you do?” Says Pluto blankly as he looks at the crashed ship lying in a pillow of snow. </p>
        <p>“Hmm, that wasn’t supposed to happen.” Says Charon blankly. </p>
        <p>The two fly there in immediately. VROWOOSH! A large flame emerges. The duo stops flying in mid air and look frantically at each other. “Pluto I swear I didn’t mean for this to happen. All I did was freeze the engine.” Says Charon unremorsefully as she plays with her fingers. </p>
        <p>“Umm, we’ll deal with this later, we gotta save the polit.” The two land down next to the burning pod and begin trying to figure out how to rescue the pilot. </p>
        <p>Pluto clenches his fists and begins breathing deeply. With each exhale his cold breath becomes more and more visible a larger. Ice begins to form around he arms. “It’s be a while since I’ve done this but here we go, f-f-frick! I forgot how cold this is!” shakes Pluto and he looks at the now forms ice gauntlets on his hands. He steps closer to the ship and begins to frantically pat and flame and tears the hatchet open. “Charon, grab him all keep it open!” </p>
        <p>Charon dashes into the pod and rushes out with the unconscious pilot. She heads back to Pluto hut, were he can recover. Pluto proceeds to roll the pod in more snow. “Ooh snap! I forgot these things are fire proof” Pluto says with relief has he inspects the pod and notices very little damage. “If anything the fire helped! The engine has completely thawed out.” Pluto heads back to his house to meet up with Charon. </p>
        <p>Some hours go by and the pilot finally wakes up. “Ahh thank you so much,” groans the pilot. He was petit as well, “I don’t know what happened, I was flying on my way to Saturn, when BAM, I crashing down here on this unknown planet.” Pluto and Charon look at each other as sweat begins dripping down their foreheads. </p>
        <p>“Don’t tell him anything,” mouths Pluto to Charon. </p>
        <p>“Thank you, greatly appreciate y’all hospitality” says the pilot. </p>
        <p>”You w-welcome!” Says the duo shaking trying to act like nothing just happened a few moments ago. </p>
        <p>“Mind if I use the bathroom?” </p>
        <p>“Not at all, it’s the door to your right” says Pluto. The pilot leaves. </p>
        <p>“Psst, Pluto, remember that telescope I got from Gaia a few years ago?” whispers Charon. </p>
        <p>“Y-yeah, why?” replies a confused Pluto. </p>
        <p>“Well I’ve bee using it to scout out pods that come nearby. Pluto remember how Jupiter said we are worthless dwarf grade planeterians. All our lives the name planetreian was just as trivial information has our favorite color. Turns out there has been a hierarchy embedded deep within our culture that we didn’t even know. There’s so much about ourselves that we’ve been oblivious too.” </p>
        <p>“Were are you going with the Charon, you’re losing me here.” Says Pluto cluelessly. </p>
        <p>“What I’m saying is. He thinks we aren’t we aren’t capable of what the others can do becomes we aren’t like them, we are ‘inferior’ he says. Well, that hogwash. If we knew how to do those things, if we learned more about ourselves and our true potential we could do anything they can!” says Charon. </p>
        <p>“Oh my gosh, you’re right!” whispers Pluto loudly with excitement. </p>
        <p>“I know I am, I always come up with good ideas,” says Charon smugly and she pats herself on the shoulder. “Saturn’s planet has a large library. I’ve never been inside of course, but from what I learned from all of Saturn’s gloating, there’s a book on everything in there. You know how the pilot said he was on his way to Saturn; well all we have to do is sneak onto his ship” </p>
        <p>“As much of an evil master mind you are Charon you forgot about one thing. We aren’t allowed to be on any major Planet in the Milky Way Galaxy, not without permission from one of the monarchs. The same monarchs that despise us now” All of Pluto’s excitement begins to flush down the drain along with his hope. </p>
        <p>“Come on silly, that’s the easiest part, all we need are disguise. We can find one once we get there.” Says Charon smugly. </p>
        <p>“Okay, but what about the pilot, won’t he find it suspicious when he comes back and we’re gone.” </p>
        <p>Charon slaps her forehead and shakes her head, “must I walk you through everything, we can just write a note saying we’re to go get some umm snow for um, repairs, to our, I mean your house.” Pluto can obviously tell she’s making it up as she goes but shrugs it off. The two write a half assed letter and dash outside towards the pod. They open the hatchet and look around. Pluto noticed a room in the back with the words cargo written on the door. The two smile at each other mischievously and the open the door and hide with the multiply large boxes of books. </p>
        <p>The pilot confused of where the nice people that helped him had gone, walks to his pod. He steps into his pod and seats in his seat. “I wonder why those two had to leave so early, I really wanted to thank.” He presses the buttons on his colorful control panel. In the blink of an eye, the pod begins to rise from the pile of up.  VROWOOSH! The pod quickly dashes up and leaves the atmosphere. “OH SHOOT, I’m out of gas! Umm what’s the nearest planet?” The pilot looks at his GPS. “Hmm, Ouranos huh, guess I’ll make a quick pit stop.” The duo still hidden in the cargo room, didn’t over hear this new wretch in their plan. </p>
