    <h6><strong>Pluto</strong></h6>
        <p>Sad after being fired and demoted along with his planet for not meetings the Milky Sector's rather generous standards (cough mercury). He's rather insecure and is easily flattered. He very kind, generous, and forgiving. He is on a journey to prove himself to his old friends back at the Milky Way Sector's Council. He has a strong sense of Chivalry and Justice. He wants to gain acceptanceâ€¯from his peers through hard work. Pluto wants to break the barrier of planeterian Classes and regain his old possession even if he's a "dwarf" grade planeterian through hard work and determination. Pluto still has a lot of respect for his old friends, and even Jupiter. He has no ill will towards him, in fact the whole situation made him more self-aware. He realized he really was holding the others back, and this fueled is determination to become a stronger better planeterian. He and Charon often talk and reminisce back on the days before the started their journey to rise up the social ladder which had never been done before successfully. Due to the low success rate of moving up the planeterian social ladder, there are times were Pluto becomes doubtful, on top of that he is already very pessimistic.</p>
        <p>Pluto is very apologetic, even if he isn't responsible for another's misfortunate he will apologize. He believes he has very bad luck, but it could just be his pessimism.
    <h6><strong>Charon</strong></h6>
	   <p>Pluto's longtime friend and partner in crime. She has a lot of respect and admiration for Pluto and wants to see him succeed. She can be a mother figure sometimes, constantly comforting Pluto when he's in his usual down mood, or calm him down when he rages (which is rare). She's just along for the ride.</p>
