		<p class="subtittle"><strong>Venus</strong></p>
		<p class="one">She has a LOT of confidence, especially when it comes to her looks. Venus is a very bubbly and optimistic individual. She can spot the beauty in any and every one, and she tends to ship people together, even when their unlikely together in the near future. Pluto x Uranus, Jupiter x Saturn, and Mercury x Gaia are some examples of ships she's currently stanning xD. She's very passionate, especially when it comes to bonds, friends, and relationships in general. Despite her name she's not obsessed with looks, and she's pretty lonely but she hides it all the time.</p>
<p class="one">Venus likes oversized jackets and despite the hot temperature on her planet she still wears them anyways. She has an especially high heat tolerance. She rarely wears a clothes underneath her jacket. She's always in the bikini and ready to party, just give her the call.</p>
<p class="one">She doesn't care if its taboo, she allowed Pluto stay in her home "unknowingly" whilst he, Charon, and Uranus figure out how to Planet Saturn. She looks a Pluto like an adorable distant cousin. Even though he's not a part of the Milky Way Council, Venus still sees him has family and will help him no matter what.</p>
