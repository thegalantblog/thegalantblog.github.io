    <h6><strong>Jupiter</strong></h6>
        <p>He is the cold egotistical second in commander of the Milky Way Sector's Alliance. He believes he's always right and acts stoic. He is responsible for firing and demoting Pluto for not meeting the already low standards, and constantly dragging down the reputation of the Milky Way Sector. When the new young planeterian Eris appeared trying to join the alliance, he realized he had to set a new precedent and keep the planeterian tradition of separating the grades.</p>
        <p>Jupiter is hypocritical. He is lazy, loves to drink, party, and sleep with women. Minerva isn't his only half breed child, she's just the most hurt and vocal. Jupiter represents everything wrong with the planeterian system, but he's also just an outlier. He's a cold, cocky, douchebag, a**hole. He cares more about his reputation than other's lively hoods. And he doesn't care since he has the powers to back up his mouth. Jupiter's thick bald butler with a dope mustache appearance is just an allusion. In reality, he is a large well dress man with thin legs and a large torso. He has an angular face and always appears to be disgusted with everything. Despite his large size, he is not out of shape at all.</p>
