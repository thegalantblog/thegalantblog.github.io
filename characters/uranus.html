    <h6><strong>Uranus</strong></h6>
        <p>Queen and Representative of the planet Ouranos. She is known by her people has being cold, scary, and paranoid. This is just an act as she has a soft spot her kids and Pluto, her secret love. She is very closed, never showing her true emotions to most people. She is also very lonely. When she heard Pluto had been dropped from the Council and demoted in status, she became very depressed. It was seen as taboo for planeterians of high ranking to hang out with the low ranking ones.</p>
        <p>She is a super cocky celestial grade planeterian. She tends to toy with her victims in battles. Uranus can come off a bit sadistic and take things too far. Uranus has very little care from her subjects because of how stuck up and spoiled she is. Uranus tends to underestimate her opponents and subjects. She has a rather dark sense of humor. However when she's around her kids and loved ones (i.e. Neptune and Pluto) her frozen heart thaws out. Uranus actually smiles when she's around them. It is shown that Uranus is rather socially awkward when she interacts with others. </p>
